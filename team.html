        <h2 id="coachCortesName">Coach Cortes</h2>
        <p id="coachCortesBio">Coach Vasquez-Cortes is in her second year as Head Coach for the Voorhees High School boys tennis team and is honored to have made her coaching debut with such a dedicated and driven group of student-athletes. While new to coaching, she brings over a decade of experience as a high school math teacher and a strong personal connection to the sport.
        <br><br>
        As a former varsity tennis player in high school, Coach Vasquez-Cortes continues to learn and grow in the game—both through mentorship at a local racquet club and by working closely with her players each season. She is passionate about helping her athletes develop not just as players, but as individuals—physically, mentally, and emotionally.
        <br><br>
        Since stepping into the coaching role, Coach Vasquez-Cortes, alongside Assistant Coach Ghaly, has helped grow the program and, with the incredible support of team parents, launched the first-ever booster club for Voorhees boys tennis. She looks forward to continuing to build the program and supporting her players on and off the court.</p>
